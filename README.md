# Policyholder Identification
##### Project Summary
Python code that categorizes auto-insurance customers into groups based on risk level.
##### Skills Used:
###### Python
* Data preprocessing to ensure data quality.
* Implementing multiple unsupervised machine learning models to search for data insights. 
* Iterated through several different clustering methods and parameters to find the optimal solution. 
##### Desired Insights
* How many risk levels are present in the data set?
* What expected cost does each risk level present to the company?
